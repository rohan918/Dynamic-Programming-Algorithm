# Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm
Optimized output of fruits in puzzle using dynamic programming

This algorithm solves a complex puzzle problem.
The puzzle is as follows: you are given a linear array of integers, which represent the number of fruits available to you in a forest.
There are invaders in the forest, who will eventually occupy the entire forest. You are able to place walls in the forest, and you will be able to
collect all the fruits on one side of the wall. However, the invaders will have the ability to occupy the side of the wall in a way that minimizes the amount of fruits that you
will be abe to collect. After the invader occupies the land on the side of the wall that they choose, you are now able to collect all of the fruits on the other side of the wall.
Now, you can place another wall on the unoccupied side of the wall, and the invaders will now repeat the process by choosing a side of the newly placed wall to minimize the amount
of fruit you will be able to collect. You will continue placing walls until the invaders have occupied the entire forest. 

This program uses dynamic programming to maximize the amount of fruits you can collect before the invaders occupy the entire forest, by finding the optimal wall placements.
